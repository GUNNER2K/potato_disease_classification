# potato_disease_classification

This project , classifies the potato leaves into 3 classes :

- healthy leaves
- early blight 
- late blight 

This is achieved using CNN . The dataset is taken from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease . The main folder will look something like this :
